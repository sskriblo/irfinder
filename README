IRFinder project based on Arduino platform. Hardware platform is Arduion Nano v.3.0 (atmel168). 
Interfaces:
- Motor interface based on the LM298 Chip;
- Servo interface to standard analog servo motor;
- Debug interface based on standart printf utility via FTDI/USB/SeritalTerminal;
- IR interface need more detais to desctiption. 

IR Interface:
IR beacon (transmitter) is LED lighting which transmites 10KHz pulses. 

IR receiver is IR diode sensor with amplifier fasted at the top of servo motor. There is bandpass 10KHz active filter for noise cancelling. Its output handles to ADC at Arduino CPU. ADC sample frequency equal to 10.5KHz. Algorithm collects 20 or more samples and calculates the signal amplitude. This amplitude depends from IR sensore angle.
